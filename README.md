# Pre-work for Code the Dream React Class

## Description 

Star Wars information page that fetches data from the Star Wars API (SWAPI - https://swapi.dev/)

## Instructions

The site is live at https://neidacreates.github.io/codethedream-prework/

You can also download the files from github and open the index.html file to interact with it locally.

The home page contains information about my favorite Star Wars character (Leia) which is automatically populated on the page without the user having to do anything. Click on the button that says "Learn More About the Films" or click on the "Films" link in the top menu bar and you will be taken to the films page. The films page has a list of all the Star Wars films. 

When you are on the film page, click on the title of a film and it will fetch the release date and opening crawl data for the film and display it underneath the list. A button will then appear, which will say "Pick Another Film." Click this button to refresh the page and display just the film list again, erasing the crawl and release date data currently being displayed.

You can navigate back to the home page by clicking the "Home" link in the menu bar.
