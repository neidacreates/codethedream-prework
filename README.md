# Pre-work for Code the Dream React Class

## Description 

Star Wars information page that fetches data from Star Wars API (SWAPI - https://swapi.dev/)

## Instructions

The site is live at https://starwars-api-practice.netlify.app/

You can also download files from github and open the index.html file to interact with it locally.

The home page contains information about my favorite Star Wars character (Leia) which is automatically populated on the page without the user having to do anything. If you click on the button that says "Learn More About the Films" you will be taken to the films page, which houses a list of all the Star Wars films. 

When you are on the film list page, if you click on the title of a film, it will fetch the release date and opening crawl data for the film and display it underneath the list. A button will then appear, which will say "Pick Another Film." If you click this button, it will refresh the page and display just the film list again, erasing the crawl and release date data currently being displayed.

You can also navigate between the home page and films page by using the menu bar at the top. If you click on the "Films" link in the menu bar, it will take you to the films list page. If you click on the "Home" link, it will take you back to the home page.
